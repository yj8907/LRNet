# LRNet in TensorFlow

Implementation of Long-Range connections in convolutional neural network. Adapted from Deep Residual Network.

Still in Progress.

## GOAL
Being able to improve on convolutional neural network by borrowing concepts neuroscience research, including anatomical and functional understanding of nervous system.
